He was just, as Jem said, \"plain dog\" â€” <em>very</em> plain dog, uncharitable people added. Certainly, Monday's looks were not his strong point. Black spots were scattered at random over his yellow carcass, one of them blotting out an eye. His ears were in tatters, for Monday was never successful in affairs of honour. But he possessed one talisman. <strong>He knew that not all dogs could be handsome or eloquent or victorious, but that every dog could love</strong>.</p>\n<p>Inside his homely hide beat the most affectionate, loyal, faithful heart of any dog since dogs were; and something looked out of his brown eyes that was nearer akin to a soul than any theologian would allow.</p>\n<p>from <em>Rilla of Ingleside</em>, the last book in the <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> series</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I thought this was so expressive. Her dog is a complete lemon yet wonderful all the same.</p>\n<p>There's a spectrum of ways to think about a person: how creative, how productive, how successful they are happen to be on one end, the clinical, high-level characteristics. The low-level characteristics are very qualitative: the things they say, their reactions to you, how they emote and relate. I wouldn't be able to describe the type of person I get along with, much as I can't draw the cloud of all things I find funny, but as soon as we interact I know what this person <em>is</em> at a low level.</p>\n<p>In SF, a lot of people like each other at a high level. Of course, wouldn't you want to be around the most awesome, creative, and interesting people you can find? But for <em>friendship</em>, what does that matter? To love, laugh, and play has everything to do with who they are and nothing to do with what they've done.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2/2/2022, 4:42:43 PM","slug":"dog-monday","title":"sndfjkn","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0bf8cb7e-307d-567f-ad7e-bfc2872df822","frontmatter__slug":"dog-monday","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"dog-monday"}}},
