Seek failures that tell you something about the underlying principles of a system.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Write the outline of a paper before the experiment.\n<ul>\n<li>this forces you to think about the <strong>analysis</strong> and not just what you're measuring</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Make use of partial successes\n<ul>\n<li>if all the neurons survive but all the glia die, what would it be about glia that makes them more vulnerable?</li>\n<li>if grey matter responds differently from white matter\n<ul>\n<li>white matter is composed of more lipids, grey matter has more water</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Seek general principles\n<ul>\n<li>Alzheimer's research is a counterexample: people are using 3 different molecular models of Alzheimer's\n<ul>\n<li>you need to find effects in all 3 models to claim general principles</li>\n<li>\"makes me want to do a company that runs human trials for Alzheimer's\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"[in our lab] the biggest failures have become our biggest successes\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>They were trying all sorts of polymers for expansion microscopy that weren't working (literally hundreds of them). \bSomeone suggested proteinases offhand, which wasn't taken seriously at the time\n<ul>\n<li>circled the problem back to physics/chemistry</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Quantity over quality</h4>\n<p>Do a lot of experiments, some of which are quite dumb.\nExamples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New paper on amyloid</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>initially it was a scatter of dots, but we realized there was periodic structure</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take a Fourier transform of an image of Alzheimers? Sounds stupid</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>important work, maybe amyloid changes the excitability of neurons\n<ul>\n<li>decades of work has found amyloid plaques to be associated with disease, but if you remove the plaque nothing happens</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Off-by-1 inputs\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Let's say you do an experiment with dose 1, dose 10, dose 100 and they all fail</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it may be that the dose is still approaching threshold, need to try dose 500</li>\n<li>only understood if you measure the right things (e.g. RNAseq)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>suppose you do EEG, RNAseq, protein - RNA can be amplified and protein can't</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dependency graph</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use it to sequence experiments, but be aware that it never actually plays out</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The scale of vitrification is on a nano scale</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>High-pressure freezing</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's unclear that the 200 micron limit is a fundamental limit, or something that can be changed with parameter search</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Double dissociation</strong> - suppose freezing the hamster fails in 8 ways, pig fails in 9 other ways - you can't make general statements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you see the same failures, you can claim underlying principles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are the first experiments?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RNAseq</li>\n<li>EEG</li>\n<li>proteins\n<ul>\n<li>are there even antibodies for pigs?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Use three model organisms</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hamster, mouse and pig</li>\n<li>The results of individual experiments are not as important as the comparison of what happens in each organism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why do pig?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pig organs are biologically harder</li>\n<li>big vessels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why hamster?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>replicate previous research</li>\n<li>Hamster might be more amenable to freezing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>marmosets are rat-sized monkeys</p>\n<p>What are the metrics?
