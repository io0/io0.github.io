That is what makes a problem important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is neurotech too early? Are there advances from other fields that we can now apply to neurotech? Is there even an attack?</p>\n<p>Boyden thinks neurotech is at a stage where we're trying to build a moon lander without calculus.</p>\n<h4>Framework 3: Look for novelty</h4>\n<p>Anjan spoke about making decisions by looking for novelty.</p>\n<h4>To what end?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology. And it is terrifically dangerous, and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In many ways, we already <em>have</em> the ability to program each other's minds. We send text through Twitter, images through Instagram, audiovisual experiences through TikTok — each time sharper, more engaging, more all-encompassing.</p>\n<p>If we haven't figured out how to use our existing technology to create good outcomes, why try to make neurotech, something even hungrier, even stronger, even more all-encompassing?</p>\n<p>Maybe Curius is something I need to figure out first before I can work on neurotech. If neurotech connects you to information, how do you decide what information to connect you to? Already we have all the information in the world via the internet, but to what end?</p>\n<p>Michael Seibel says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the genius is not in the solution, it's in the problem</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and I think there's something really genius about the question of how to shape people's minds. (spoiler: modern internet is not doing it well)</p>\n<h5>Appendix</h5>\n<h4>Artists</h4>\n<p>Neural interface companies need artists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steve Jobs's craft was creating demos that make your heart and soul sing. While the other companies were creating massive feature sets, Steve focused on a single compelling demo</li>\n<li>The original Pixar movie was good because of the storytelling</li>\n<li>Microsoft hired a YouTuber to envision AR technology</li>\n<li>Andy Matuschak was most excited about a feature on the Apple watch where he could tap the watch, and his partner's watch would glow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There must be a version of neurotech that feels compelling, and that version should have nothing to do with technology and everything to do with people</p>\n<p>(BCI is interesting to me when we can share new mental spaces — what we love is still people, rather than things)</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2/2/2022, 4:42:43 PM","slug":"march","title":"sndfjkn","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"20958c2b-13f1-5cb7-b46c-40be48ce104c","frontmatter__slug":"march","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"march"}}},
