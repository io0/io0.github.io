We are Raffi and Marley, and we are not investors in neurotechnology.</p>\n<h2>The substrate</h2>\n<p>Your brain is a (<em>very</em>) large network of neurons. It is sparsely connected, and compared to a random network, we've detected that it has more feedforward loops and\n<img src=\"attachments/70642748.png\" alt=\"70642748.png\">\nMice have more synapses per neuron? linear in synapses, <span class=\"annotation\">It's been discovered that primates actually have <em>less</em> connections per neuron than mice</span>\nStateful</p>\n<p>There is a deterministic mapping from genes to neurons in <em>C. Elegans</em>, a creature with 302 neurons. In humans, the network is dynamic, lacks predetermination. Notice that there is more information in your 10^11 neurons than your 10^9-bp genome. Nerves grow through a random search strategy, which you can get an intuition for by looking at the vessels of your arms.</p>\n<!--Further, your brain structure will look different from moment to moment, to say nothing of the differences from one person to another. -->\n<p>Your own brain structure will look different from your brain structure at t-100ms, to say nothing of the differences from one person to another.</p>\n<p>[highly complex solution to a problem, if you \"solve\" one brain you don't have the key to another]</p>\n<p>In fact, the brain is stateful in two ways. In the physical structure of its connections, and in the \"on\" or \"off\" state of its neurons.
