From China to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto, I followed along while my parents figured out Western society for themselves.

Each moment carried its own little witch trial.</p>\n<!-- I was always in anticipation of these tiny little witch trials. -->\n<p>Childhood created an immense inner life. One time when I was seven we had to write short stories. There were twenty or so stories about a boy named Sam looking for his puppy. Next to them, in monk-like handwriting, was about a bird named Springshine.</p>\n<p>I was fascinated by the color chartreuse. I loved and collected things like that. It made me happy to learn they existed, images with fresh attachments and mouth-feel. They went straight into a basket that included Mongols, politics, prickly pears, gossamer, Gothic churches and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King\">Monkey King</a>. I didn't know what they really were but had a preverbal sense that they were fantastic.</p>\n<!-- Sunk into preverbal awe\nHard-won day of pretending to be a kid,\nPretend to be a kid, grand charade, take on whatever acts were desired take it seriously\nPlayed my role as a \nhard-won performance, \nputting on performances at school, \nThe hours spent inside a Word processor were hours playing with textures in my mind.

I wrote in a single Word document that grew to 110,000 words long. To write was to play with mind-textures. I didn't love them because they were inexplicable, nor because I couldn't seem to find them in others, but because they were the most fantastic, beaming elements of my reality.</p>\n<!-- Search space\nWeb Textures I could feel in my mind but could never find in others.  -->\n<hr>\n<p>The cryostat operated much like a footpedal loom.
