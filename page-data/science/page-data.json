My gut screams \"no\" but my head says \"but of course!\" This job will kill me, this job will be the most fascinating environment I've ever been in.</p>\n<p>Max has a dominating presence. He speaks far too fast, with far too much novelty per word. I kept thinking he reminded me of someone — and just now, reflecting on it, realize it was Jose.</p>\n<p>He says the two problems with neural interfaces are interconnections and packaging. He says Neuralink was a brutal lesson that no matter how thin you make the wires, how clever you are, you should never put things in the brain. There's just no space there. The needle for insertion is tiny, yet it causes damage. (I also heard that the electronic components don't move in the same way that biological material does in the brain, causing repeated scarring over time — I don't remember if it was Max who said so though.)</p>\n<p>I asked why they didn't start with motor, he said it was <em>too easy</em>. He took it for granted that they would be able to do motor. Sight is a grand challenge, is something no one has ever done before.</p>\n<p>No neuroscientist has been able to restore sight. There are existing implants,\nMore phosphenes is not sight.</p>\n<p>He showed me slides of their progress, then when we got to the pictures of the chip, then he said, \"You haven't seen our microscope? Let's go see our microscope\" then we made a beeline through the lab to the microscope, which was off, then he said \"this is a million dollar microscope\" then we went straight back to the conference room.</p>\n<p>They all love their job, but then again, none of them have worked with Raffi.</p>\n<p>I feel like in under an hour I got to learn all of his secrets.</p>\n<p>Science occupies a grey warehouse. The primary office space is cavernous,  with only a small island of desks in the middle.</p>\n<p>They make progress every week. Emma got COVID last week and she was sad because she felt like she was missing out on all the cool progress that was happening.</p>\n<p>I like Emma the most here. She's very nice, looks like some of my friends, speaks with energy and clarity.</p>\n<p>Kylie kept offering me snacks.</p>\n<p>At the end he said, \"what should we do next?\" and I was like, \"well, it's up to you.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-12-14, 17:17","slug":"science","title":"Science","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"85e6ed00-7401-5d93-a21f-52a8d276935a","frontmatter__slug":"science","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"science"}}},
