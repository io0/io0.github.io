If I were to introduce an entirely new sensory input — say, sight to the congenitally blind — how quickly/completely would the human be able to rewire the cortex to process the input?</p>\n<p>On the one hand, when you expose people to sight for the first time in adulthood, most of them never learn to see. Visual input is too strange, too distracting. They prefer being blind.</p>\n<p>On the other, the brain is extremely plastic [given the need].</p>\n<p>When monkeys were trained to control a bionic arm, they learned faster when the mapping was changed within the manifold than outside of it.</p>\n<p>Could you simulate the qualitative experience of seeing with the implant?\nOpthamologists have setups where they project lasers onto the retina.</p>\n<p>Is the goal to create new visual worlds?
