We ran a couple virtual socials, which were fun but weren't influential in decisions either way. I held my breath leading up to School 2.0, worried that people wouldn't like each other. Only after a week or two, seeing everyone gathered in Geffen's bedroom for late night snacks, did I feel release.</p>\n<p>Learning happens in an environment rich in surprise. The people were new, and so was everything else about Truchas. We were surrounded by rich affordances: trails, rivers, horses you could feed whenever you wanted to.
