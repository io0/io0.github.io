Like, I finally get a blank slate because nobody knows much about my background, I’m finally in a place where close to 100% of the conversations I have are interesting, I finally feel obligated to be the best version of me all the time, and it’s actually ridiculous how much more clearly i can think now</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>School 2.0 was an experiment in learning in Truchas, New Mexico. It started out of existential need: everything was shut down in October 2020 and no one was thinking about the disaster in young people's mental lives. It was a space for people to learn and be together, and it grew into an expression of what education could look like.</p>\n<!-- What Raffi and I thought education should look like, we did things intuitively \ngrew/\nan expression/instantiation of what Raffi and I thought education should look like.\n-->\n<p>We found a farmhouse in a remote village. There were 26 of us in all, average age 22 years old (min 18, max 29). We found people through word of mouth and referral, posting to communities like Interact, Pioneer, Neo, and Hack Lodge. Our <a href=\"https://school2point0.com/\">webpage</a> was designed for people who love projects.</p>\n<p>We ran a minimalist selection process: a form and a 15-minute chat. We asked one question: what are you curious about? We looked for people who could teach us things.</p>\n<!-- \"resume-free\"\nlow-level qualities\n\nbiology, math, physics,\n\n\n#### Recruiting/people composition\nLooking for people who can teach us things.\ncuriosity + kindness\nself-selected for authenticity -->\n<h4>Friendships</h4>\n<!-- There was no way to know beforehand if people would like each other. We ran a couple virtual socials, which were fun but weren't influential in decisions either way.  -->\n<p>I was worried sick in the days leading up to School 2.0. What if people didn't like each other? We were convincing everyone to come to something we ourselves didn't know. Most people came in blind or with only one other person they knew from before.</p>\n<p>In the second week, there was a moment when everyone gathered in Geffen's bedroom for late night snacks, and I feel a sense of release. This was going to work.</p>\n<p>Almost everyone continued to live with each other in smaller group homes after School 2.0. Vincent went to Alaska with Dmitri, who ended up being the person with whom he \"spent the most time with this year\". On two separate occasions I lived with friends and their families, in Boston and Ecuador.</p>\n<h4>Learning through people (aka \"brainwash\")</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Vincent - David</li>\n<li>Noah</li>\n<li>the dropouts / time off school (Vincent, Steve, Liam, Jonathan, Will)</li>\n<li>Emma</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Play</h4>\n<p>Raffi</p>\n<ul>\n<li>types of projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Geffen and Steve were going on about hot air balloon houses\nChinese character writing\nWill writing his 1000-word blog posts\nGeffen's LED lights\nSVD\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10531\">[1810.10531] A mathematical theory of semantic development in deep neural networks</a>\npredicting who would be friends with who\nsanti and steve whiteboarding\nnoah, marley, and vincent shapes\nturned the kitchen upside down\nsardines\ndressing up as each other, video\nsnowball fight</p>\n<p>self initiated\ncomparison with school\ndemo at the end of the week</p>\n<h4>Shared experiences</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>cooking - 5 hour experience</li>\n<li>eating</li>\n<li>hiking</li>\n<li>walks (were the only 1:1 activity)</li>\n<li>cleaning</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Structured stuff</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>learning experiment</li>\n<li>paper experiment</li>\n<li>Missing Piece</li>\n<li>big questions club</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things that weren't there</p>\n<ul>\n<li>status</li>\n<li>social media</li>\n</ul>\n<p>felt consistently good</p>\n<h4>Venue is way more important than we thought</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>sunniness</li>\n<li>library</li>\n<li>upstairs vs downstairs\n<ul>\n<li>library upstairs, rooms downstairs</li>\n<li>people upstairs collaborated more</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Could I live in this state?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>no</li>\n<li>I want to return to this at some frequency</li>\n<li>did not seem compatible with \"execution mode\"\n<ul>\n<li>people with jobs seemed to do fine / get work done, but my sense is that the particularly self-driven types of work suffered</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning happens in an environment rich in surprise.
