You have to forgo brownie points.</p>\n<p>Places can look like circlejerks</p>\n<p>Balance between intimacy and legibility [of Twitter, of social capital]</p>\n<p>I want to know, but I dont want to know too much</p>\n<p>Mercenaries</p>\n<p>Taylor says I should fight for another startup for a while, but .
