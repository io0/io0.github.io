His medium is air. He is bathed in electromagnetic waves, pressure, chemicals. He can sense a small range of a few signals and respond by the contraction and extension of fibrous cells on his body.</p>\n<p>His sensors and effectors interact with the environment; his cognition interacts with the subenvironment of their neural impulses. His cognition is a volume <em>circumscribed by his sensors and effectors.</em></p>\n<p>You'll notice that his sensors and effectors are <em>biologically plausible</em>. He generates forces on the order of 2 to 7 g/mm^2, and cannot exert forces or detect changes on time scales lower than a couple milliseconds. Naturally, his cognition operates within this space.</p>\n<p>They coevolved to be <em>useful for survival</em>.</p>\n<p>The world surface has changed. Light, for which he has dedicated 40% of his brain, is no longer the primary house of information: everywhere around you, information is flowing in the modulation of currents.</p>\n<p>Have accepted these design constraints:\nmoving, adaptable circuitry</p>\n<p>His effectors are individually addressable, but more often are packaged into behaviors.</p>\n<p>His sensors and effectors circumscribe a volume which is his cognition.\nYou are a brain, sensors, and effectors. Sensors transduce the environment: EM waves, pressure, chemicals. Your main effector is the contraction and relaxation of fibrous cells. The brain is the volume</p>\n<p>The sensors and effectors are constrained by what was <em>biologically plausible</em> and <em>useful for survival</em>.</p>\n<p>These were built as interfaces to <em>world</em>, and adapted to be the same interfaces to <em>people</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021/12/29, 14:20","slug":"towards-neurotechnology","title":"","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"19b540ad-6967-5b8a-8ab5-14c403491ec8","frontmatter__slug":"towards-neurotechnology","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"towards-neurotechnology"}}},
