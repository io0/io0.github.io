<li>Mackenzie said that when she visited the School 2.0 website, she felt super intimidated
<ul>
<li>"There's no way I could go to this"</li>
<li>The section with our projects intimidated her most. Over dinner she asked me if everyone from the wheelchair project ended up going to School 2.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Max is so funny and inhuman
<ul>
<li>He wasn't there for my presentation and I never saw him interact with the rest of the team</li>
<li>There seemed to be a huge cultural difference between Max and his team. Max is super opinionated and weird, but everyone else was normal and had no opinions
<ul>
<li>Perhaps that's what this team is: people with technical talent following a person with vision.</li>
<li>It seems easy to hire academics and professors. The people there all said their academic jobs had been meaningless*<span class=annotation>*my interpretation</span> and isolating
<ul>
<li>One person was invited to come on site for 4 days, and he said that after day 1 he knew he wanted to join. Why? Because he saw how cool it was to have a team</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He also seems to trust his team  — when we had our 1:1, he said "I don't have any questions for you, it's up to Alan"</li>
<li>I asked him what he learned in the past week
<ul>
<li>He said he thought there was no such thing as a secret — all the information is out there: the market, the laws of nature. So he was always dismissive when people claim they had a secret and thought it was a red flag*<span class="annotation">*David said this too</span> (i.e. stealth companies). But then he said he found his first real secret, and started seeing that <em>everything</em> is run on secrets. Over the past 3 years he's started to see every industry as a place full of secrets and doesn't trust the news anymore
<ul>
<li>with Science, he says he's now sitting on 3 or 4 real secrets</li>
<li>tbh this feels a bit like bullshit but ¯_(ツ)_/¯</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you know physics, you can create "existence proofs" — once you know something <em>can</em> exist, then you can feel confident trying to figure out <em>how</em> to make it exist
<ul>
<li>Max says he learned this from Elon</li>
<li>I asked if he knew physics and he said yes</li>
<li>I asked for an example
<ul>
<li>Micro OLED technology has been sold for $1B+ to companies like Apple and Google, so everyone assumes there's something super complicated about making Micro OLEDs and Max was worried that they wouldn't be able to bid for the technology
<ul>
<li>he looked at the actual specs, the "arrangement of atoms", and decided it wasn't actually that hard to make</li>
<li>within 2 weeks, the team built an OLED display in-house</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone on the team was looking forward to "next Tuesday, when we do our first rabbit surgery"
<ul>
<li>Jennie described her role as "doing 3 postdocs at once"</li>
<li>they built an OR (operating room) right in the middle of their office — yes, in between desks! — and everyone helped build it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mackenzie says Laura's mom is really really nice</li>
