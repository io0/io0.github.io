<!-- Being a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script yet in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

Take a kid who has yet to develop a single social script to a context that requires a lot of them in a short amount of time and the experience of humanity becomes surreal. 
Five-year-olds have yet to learn a single social script. Place them in a context that requires a lot of them in a short amount of time and the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script. Being in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

For a child without a single social script to learn the way of these Western worlds on their own, the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was five and had yet to know a single social script; being required to learn a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity surreal.

<p>I changed schools once a year for six years. From China to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto, I followed along while my parents figured out Western society for themselves. I had yet to learn a single social script when I was forced to learn many at once; my experience of humanity became quite stunning.</p>

Learn French — now learn English; learn what pizza is because everyone seems to know it and if you don't then you must be dumb or strange. My heart rate spiked, I girded my loins. Each moment carried its own little witch trial.</p>
<!-- I was always in anticipation of these tiny little witch trials. -->
<p>Childhood created an immense inner life. One time when I was seven we had to write short stories. There were twenty or so stories about a boy named Sam looking for his puppy. Next to them, in monk-like handwriting, was about a bird named Springshine.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by the color chartreuse. I loved and collected things like that. It made me happy to learn they existed, images with fresh attachments and mouth-feel. They went straight into a basket that included Mongols, politics, prickly pears, gossamer, Gothic churches and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King">Monkey King</a>. I didn't know what they really were but had a preverbal sense that they were fantastic.</p>

<p>So it went; every day I went to school and put on a good performance, then rushed home to write. I wrote in a single Word document that grew to 110,000 words long. To write was to play with mind-textures. I didn't love them because they were inexplicable, nor because I couldn't seem to find them in others, but because they were the most fantastic, beaming elements of my reality.</p>
