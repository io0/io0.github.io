<!-- Being a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script yet in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

Take a kid who has yet to develop a single social script to a context that requires a lot of them in a short amount of time and the experience of humanity becomes surreal. 
Five-year-olds have yet to learn a single social script. Place them in a context that requires a lot of them in a short amount of time and the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script. Being in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

For a child without a single social script to learn the way of these Western worlds on their own, the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was five and had yet to know a single social script; being required to learn a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity surreal.

<p>I changed schools once a year for six years. From China to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto, I followed along while my parents figured out Western society for themselves. I had yet to learn a single social script when I was forced to learn many at once; my experience of humanity became quite stunning.</p>

<!-- I was always in anticipation of these tiny little witch trials. -->
<p>Childhood created an immense inner life. One time when I was seven we had to write short stories. There were twenty or so stories about a boy named Sam looking for his puppy. Next to them, in monk-like handwriting, was about a bird named Springshine who flew around the world to change the seasons.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by the color chartreuse. I loved and collected things like that. It made me happy to learn they existed, I collected bits and pieces of text about politics, old things, churches, dragons, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King">Monkey King</a>, the Yukon. I didn't know what they really were, but had a preverbal sense that these things were fantastic.</p>
<!-- Textures I could feel in my mind but could never find in others.  -->
<p>I truly loved the textures I could feel in my mind. I wrote short stories in a single Word document that grew to 102k words by the time I was 12.</p>
<!-- I discovered science a little less organically. A teacher in high school told me I was good, and everyone said the sciences were hard, so I took as many of them as I could.  -->
<p>I was nudged into science in high school. Everyone said the subject was challenging, and it seemed like biology might have answers about the mind. Action preceded love; only after a couple brutalistic readings of Campbell Biology did I see biology as fantastic.</p>
<p>my internal vocabulary consisted of elements of fantasy books.

<p>I was not awkward . Interacting with people fell into a conscious part of the brain. Planning what to say next, watching rigidly for what to do.</p>
<p>Research had the qualia of being spawned at a random point on a game map. I was working with ideas like PEG-PLA and nano evaporation, cooking up nanoparticles with sonication arbitrary instantiation.</p>
