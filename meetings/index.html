<h4>Entry from 2021-12-12 23:48</h4>
<p>I met Joel today — it was cool. They had a human brain in a vat, over their fireplace. A real brain... that was once a real person. He didn't seem surprised by it at all, and when I asked how it got there, he answered, "well, we have a neuroscience professor in the house."</p>
<p>Joel's story is that he was working full-time, and he released Artbreeder as a side project. I remember what it looked like in the beginning, circa 2018. It generated a lot of strange, abnormal-looking creatures that weren't particularly aesthetic.</p>
<p>But now the art has become <em>good</em>— fantastical, imaginative. The project grew and went viral on TikTok. Someone on Youtube made a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZZaGvcbBSo&#x26;ab_channel=Markiplier">video</a> about artbreeder that got 3 million views (this happened a couple months ago). So Artbreeder is now profitable enough to be his full-time thing.</p>
<p>It took a while. Artbreeder got started in 2018, and it really needed the GANs to get better before it started taking off 3 years later.</p>
<h1>Molly Mielke</h1>
<p>We hung out over dinner at Burma Love. She's headed to Argentina with Devon Zuegel and a bunch of other Twitter friends for the holidays.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm kind of glad that those people are doing that, because it's a snapshot of what older friendships are like</li>
<li>(Laura is in South Africa with a bunch of <em>her</em> friends for the holidays)
<ul>
<li>in the future our friend group will have a higher net worth and we can go to Argentina</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quitting Figma</h4>
<ul>
<li>she <em>loved</em> Figma the first time she was there for an internship, but when she came back for full-time she hated it
<ul>
<li>in less than a year the team grew a ton and no longer feels like a startup</li>
<li>Figma is now an enterprise product. Doing design for an enterprise product is not creative, mostly involves responding to feature requests from sales teams</li>
<li>On the day she started full-time, she knew she wanted to quit (similar to Mackenzie)</li>
<li>she loved her manager when she was an intern, they would do stuff together, but now she has a manager who is more hands-off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Moth Minds</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moth Minds is a platform for donors
<ul>
<li>she has an initial cohort of 10 different donors, people like Patrick Collison who are well-known in different fields</li>
<li>Andy and Taylor are donating as a group
<ul>
<li>Taylor has always wanted to make a design studio (for people like Azlen and Matt), I'm glad that he's finally taking steps forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the value of a grant is more than money; she believes the brand and credibility of the donor is extremely important
<ul>
<li>she's acting mostly like a consultant; she's making a home page for each donor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The idea of Moth Minds came to her two years ago, and seems extremely obvious
<ul>
<li>she started talking to people about it and taking it more seriously around a month ago</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people want to start grants. The idea of Moth Minds is easy, I just have to execute on it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Contracting</h4>
<p><strong>Contracting is a great way to have a community</strong>. Molly is working on Moth Minds alone, so she took preemptive steps to make sure she doesn't go crazy. She is doing two part-time jobs: a writing role at Stripe Press with Tamara Winter and one other person, under Patrick Collison, and a design role at <strong>Primer</strong> making a blogging platform for the kids. She's doing one day on each contracting role every week, and spending the rest of her time on Moth Minds.</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought this was really interesting</li>
<li>My mental model of work is that you should only be doing one thing, ever. Perhaps there's another statement, equally axiomatic: you have to be with people. If the second is not satisfied, then maybe you should trade off on the first?
<ul>
<li>there was a time at Google X when I was also doing a side project that took most of my time from 6 pm to 3 am, then I would show up to work and be pretty low-energy for the daytime. I thought that this was evidence that you shouldn't do multiple things at once, but perhaps there's something about doing a job that provides a lower-amplitude but consistent form of feedback that you don't get from independent projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I asked if she would have trouble context-switching, but basically she said it's worth it.
<ul>
<li>It's also about knowing yourself. She has experimented with different modes of work before</li>
<li>She also thinks that the people you work with in contracting can also help you with your own thing. I believe this, esp since the contracting roles seem high-quality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The contracting roles are in a team (of contractors). She's working directly with 2 other people at Stripe and 1 other person at Primer.
<ul>
<li>I think pair-programming or the equivalent should be the default mode of working. There's this implicit assumption that people should be treated like separate processors in wait of a task, but I think it's the thing in between people that gets stuff done
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mit-undergraduate-math-student-pushes-frontier-of-graph-theory-20201130?curius=3">Sah and Sawhney</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge">Larry and Sergey</a></li>

<h1>Mackenzie</h1>
<p>Mackenzie is awesome! We hung out for a couple hours on the night before my flight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laura told her she could be a good VC, she has a good sense of people
<ul>
<li>I think so too. She perceives and verbalizes things about people that I usually only sense subconsciously:
<ul>
<li>she said Max is autistic, observed that at Science's own party Max was just wandering around, staring at people without saying a word</li>
<li>she says that Steve gives her Cambridge vibes, he has eclectic interests that he takes seriously for the sake of it</li>
<li>she wants to like Molly but feels she's full of too many Twitter aphorisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She says Laura tries to fit her into a category of people, and currently it's the "zen buddhist" category</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She met Milan recently and really likes him</li>
<li>She says Laura never prepares for meetings, she just goes into them and does well
<ul>
<li>probably from a lot of practice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I told her that we were possibly speaking with competitors, and she said that Laura is speaking with a competitor tomorrow
<ul>
<li>about what? she doesn't even know — Laura isn't even preparing for the meeting!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She said her interview with Laura went horribly
<ul>
<li>I said I suspect that our real-time evaluations of our conversations are often wrong (thinking about my meetings in Boston, I usually felt horrible during them but then people would extend an invitation at the end to hang out more)</li>
<li>she said maybe just the bar is really low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A lot of leverage that Laura has comes from being in the original batch of Thiel fellows
<ul>
<li>all of their investors are people she met when she was 16 and have built relationships with</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>These people literally watched her grow up</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She can't take Loyal seriously
<ul>
<li>longevity for dogs is funny</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I told her she was my only female friend and we laughed about it, she also only has one other female friend</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recruiting</h4>
<ul>
<li>It's a loop that you can learn quickly; she told me I should do it once so that I have it under my belt</li>
<li>She spent 3 hours a day on work this week (LOL)
<ul>
<li>Laura has to speak with the high-profile people directly, so Laura often has to do most of the writing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mackenzie just wants to work on consciousness. How does one work on consciousness? She's just hoping to be in a place that gets her closer to what it is.</p>
<p>She speaks with high precision. In conversation she alters your mode of thinking, flips a switch in your brain so that you seek greater precision yourself.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/meetings/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-c28e3682d3108d6de117.js"],"app":["/app-40e0c4c58c6b0852e2b4.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-0e456020558958a6b696.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-8d2f1af9d8848c70185c.js"],"component---src-pages-markdown-remark-frontmatter-slug-js":["/component---src-pages-markdown-remark-frontmatter-slug-js-8a69e30532d0b70ad663.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-c28e3682d3108d6de117.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-pages-markdown-remark-frontmatter-slug-js-8a69e30532d0b70ad663.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-40e0c4c58c6b0852e2b4.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-c994c0529d0491ad085b.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-207d26c7e454bf50c4ad.js" async=""></script></body></html>
