# Artists
Neural interface companies need artists.
- Steve Jobs's craft was creating demos that make your heart and soul sing. While the other companies were creating massive feature sets, Steve focused on a single compelling demo
- The original Pixar movie was good because of the storytelling
- Microsoft hired a YouTuber to envision AR technology
- Andy Matuschak was most excited about a feature on the Apple watch where he could tap the watch, and his partner's watch would glow.

There must be a version of neurotech that feels compelling, and that version should have nothing to do with technology and everything to do with people

(my own feeling is BCI is compelling when we can share new mental spaces â€” what we love is still people, rather than things)

# Visual stimulation

Recently I went to demo Varjo, a VR headset with human-eye resolution.

There were enough issues with motion artifacts that you couldn't fully believe the scenes were real. Even so, I felt like an infant, interested in the appearance of the world. I stared at desks and carpets, knelt to look at the floor, crawled to see things from below.

Two other things stuck out. Teleporting in the space felt real, the closest you could get to teleporting in real life. Also, I felt delight whenever I saw an object suspended in the air.

Sleep is fascinating. It is when the brain is decoupled from inputs, and patterns of oscillation arise from the synapses and connections as they were right before you sleep.

Dogs are the perfect interface.

I pet the dog because I want to. I play with the dog because I want to. Every interaction is the means and the end. No extra movements to navigate the interface.

There's a sense in which websites are just places. Like college, a cafe, or Singapore. Web users can teleport anywhere, so places on the web tend to be formed around their internal characteristics, like interests, hobbies, and problems.

People make places. Tumblr was filled with teenagers. Pinterest started off with middle-aged moms. The more middle-aged moms there were, the more middle-aged moms it attracted, and now it has 400 million people, most of which are middle-aged moms.

Places are bespoke. A cafe might have reading lamps, jazz music, green velvet chairs. Our psychological space is enormous, so the value of a place is how it constrains it. The cafe has rich affordances to get you to read, to linger.

My eyes have been bad recently, maybe 5% worse than normal vision. I can still read, but it eats at me. One time yesterday, I opened an essay, started reading, then dropped it completely. *Never mind, I don't feel like it.*

I wonder if these papercuts are present elsewhere. The iPad replaces clicks with taps and makes you more likely to play with it. What are we not doing that we would like to, but don't because it's unpleasant?
