<!-- Being a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script yet in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

Take a kid who has yet to develop a single social script to a context that requires a lot of them in a short amount of time and the experience of humanity becomes surreal. 
Five-year-olds have yet to learn a single social script. Place them in a context that requires a lot of them in a short amount of time and the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script. Being in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

For a child without a single social script to learn the way of these Western worlds on their own, the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was five and had yet to know a single social script; being required to learn a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity surreal.
suddenly you get a stunning experience of humanity.
the experience of living quickly became surreal
quite suddenly I got a stunning experience of humanity.

I changed schools once a year for six years. From China to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto, I followed along while my parents figured out Western society for themselves. I had yet to learn a single social script when I was forced to learn many at once; my experience of humanity became quite stunning.

who would laugh uproariously when they were in a group. Laugh when you're supposed to, but not too loud, and not too long. Learn French â€” now learn English; learn what pizza is because everyone seems to know it and if you don't then you must be dumb or strange. My heart rate spiked, I girded my loins. Each moment carried its own little witch trial.
<!-- I was always in anticipation of these tiny little witch trials. -->

Childhood created an immense inner life. One time when I was seven we had to write short stories. There were twenty or so stories about a boy named Sam looking for his puppy. Next to them, in monk-like handwriting, was about a bird named Springshine.

I was fascinated by the color chartreuse. I loved and collected things like that. It made me happy to learn they existed, images with fresh attachments and mouth-feel. They went straight into a basket that included Mongols, politics, prickly pears, gossamer, Gothic churches and the [Monkey King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King). I didn't know what they really were but had a preverbal sense that they were fantastic. 

<!-- Sunk into preverbal awe

So it went; every day I went to school and put on a good performance, then rushed home to write. I wrote in a single Word document that grew to 110,000 words long. To write was to play with mind-textures. I didn't love them because they were inexplicable, nor because I couldn't seem to find them in others, but because they were the most fantastic, beaming elements of my reality.

<!-- I discovered science a little less organically. A teacher in high school told me I was good, and everyone said the sciences were hard, so I took as many of them as I could.  -->

I was nudged into science in high school. Everyone said the subject was challenging, and it seemed like biology might have answers about the mind. Action preceded love; only after a couple brutalistic readings of Campbell Biology did I see biology as fantastic.


my internal vocabulary consisted of elements of fantasy books. 
dragon-fairy lenses. 

Passion infected everything I do

Learning had this feeling of fear (tensorflow during first year)

oly had palpable tenor, legitimately felt I had lived more in those 5 days than years

Raffi had mental elements disjoint from his surroundings


traumatizing to have to stay in Canada


At a different level, no one could express anything. 

Computational neuroscience seems fake, neuroscience seems fake.

Interface theory of perception, how would YOU test this problem?
- noise vs noise
knowing that neurons can grow into the brain...
- also, C. Elegans hasn't been simulated yet!!

it takes time to build up courage for this problem
Society has a huge blind spot, it take scourage to think that everyone was wrong, moralistic/theatric connotation to doing that

I was not awkward . Interacting with people fell into a conscious part of the brain. Planning what to say next, watching rigidly for what to do.

Research had the qualia of being spawned at a random point on a game map. I was working with ideas like PEG-PLA and nano evaporation, cooking up nanoparticles with sonication arbitrary instantiation.

Raffi remarked that to do neurotech properly, you needed to know math, physics, neuroscience, and design.

# Courage

#### 1. Study physics

#### 2. Take Boyden's research course

#### 3. Work at Science
