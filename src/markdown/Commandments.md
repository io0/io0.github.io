**Follow the science.**
A scientific problem has no reason to stay inside a particular field. If your problem takes you into chemistry then learn chemistry. Fields are fake; self-identity is a hindrance; nature will not be cognitively pleasant.

**Know that you can learn**
We are all general intelligences. Differences in the current state of anyone's brain are all noise in light of our astounding biological ability to learn.

**Learning is learning**
I often get caught feeling bad or feeling good about learning, but neither of those really make sense. Even if all I've done is struggle, all the same I've been learning.

I'm not saying this for spirit or for morale, but because it seems like the truth of what learning is. If you spend five hours on a problem and can't figure out the answer, it doesn't mean you haven't learned, it means _you spent five hours learning_. Your brain has rewired and formed new attractor states, you've done necessary work, the activity you've done is called learning.
