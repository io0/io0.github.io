I ate too much chocolate.

I don’t know why I did it. Jonathan and I walked to Kougn Amann, we got a croissant, I wanted a power plug for a place to work, he told me to go to Cafe Neve where there’s a really good cookie. So despite not wanting a cookie, I got a cookie, and ate half of it before realizing I didnt want to eat the cookie, so now I’m left thinking why the heck did I do this.
