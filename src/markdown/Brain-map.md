Neurons operate at all levels of scale.

Stimulating a single neuron increases probability of a rat responding.

Milisecond precision is necessary to capture network dynamics. Action potentials last 2 ms and their closely associated calcium fluctuations last between 1 ms (rise) and 10-100 ms (drops). Optical dyes have a lot of nice properties for recording (e.g. we can record from 1 million neurons!) but they rely on calcium as an indicator: we can't draw causal relationships from the data at that time resolution.
