My behavior in Toronto is entirely different from in Montreal. It's quiet here, I have no urges to leave the house, my head wanders in cyberspace instead of a real city.

All my activities have become technopunk. I sit and read and teleport all day. Is that dystopic?

Yesterday I started and published a Gatsby website, started and finished a book, researched for a NeuroTech FAQ. Today I added 18 entries to Curius, read an entire neuroscience blog from first post to last, and made a 3D simulation of neural spiking.

I'm hyperactive. There is both more and less of me here, because there's no outside noise or distraction, but everything I read is the sound of other people's thoughts. And who's to say which is which?

You're probably in the wild right now. For all practical purposes you're in the 18th century, and I'm in the 21st century, and isn't it weird how life has such secrets?

I'm anxious once again about the Valley. It rises and falls, my perception of the space that lies behind two weeks. Sometimes I'm excited like a child.

I'm calmer when I think about the week before it instead, the solidity of your existence and delight of touching you once again.
