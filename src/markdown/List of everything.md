# Visual stimulation

Recently I went to demo a Varjo headset, a state-of-the-art VR with human eye resolution around the fovea.

The others that I went with were not impressed. They complained about motion artifacts and the frame rate, saying it did not look real.

But even as they complained, each person spent well over *an hour* in the environment. Without prompting, they may have spent many more.

The demos were noninteractive, a scene of an apartment and an artist's studio. I spent ages staring at a desk, circling around objects, kneeling to look at the floor. I felt as an infant, fascinated by the appearance of the world.

Sleep is fascinating. It is when the brain is decoupled from inputs, and patterns of oscillation arise from the synapses and connections as they were right before you sleep

Rhythms of the Brain says that the tongue is a better implement of BCI-like tasks

# Artists
Neural interface companies need artists.
- Steve Jobs's craft was creating demos that make your heart and soul sing. While the other companies were creating massive feature sets, Steve focused on a single compelling demo
- The original Pixar movie was good because of the storytelling
- Microsoft hired the YouTube guy to create videos for their technology
- Andy Matuschak was most excited about a feature on the Apple watch where he could tap the face, and his partner's watch would glow.

There must be a version of neurotech that feels compelling, and that version should have nothing to do with consensus reality


my own view? BCI is compelling when we can share new mental spaces â€” what we love is still people, rather than things.

#### Interesting north stars
Lidar detection in the iPhone led to a single production feature: facial recognition. But what does it point to?

What if all of my data travelled with me? What if I could use anyone's phone as my own?

# Scale-free systems
How are things distributed? Log-normal?

# Weber's law
How is it implemented? Mostly potassium conductance.

Why do I love BCIs? I love myself, I have watched the cartwheels my mind makes

Studying biology in high school gave me a sense of the topography rather than specific instantiations of biology.

What is the shape of biology? It's a big blob, wide as wide as you desire!

I loved evolution for the logic of organisms. Sponges, cnidaria, shark, bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, history embedded in living evidence.

DNA as a design was mind-blowing.

I wish teachers had asked, "how do you think life works?"

# Surprising

Volitional control of single neurons
People can learn chicken genders after a lot of training
Blindsight
Brain removal
Chess intuition
Furries acquire ghost touch in VR
Lack of stability
- the chances of olfactory activation remaining the same is 1 in 15

# Developmental 

There was a study with two cats who were kept in the dark except for one hour per day of light. In the light, one cat could move with their legs, and the other could only follow. Only the cat who navigated the environment in the light learned sight.

Most people with congenital blindness never learn how to see, preferring to go back to the dark.



# Central pattern generators


# Hippocampus
What seems like a huge inefficiency: memories live first in the hippocampus, then get transferred to the cortex.

# Optical flow
Humans are analogous to rats in a cage. 

# Functional teams
McGill NeuroTech was a functional team. People had an emotional, object-level desire to get things done.

Every part of the neuronal membrane is capable of generating action potentials

# Hallucinations
Words are vectors in the latent space of the brain
To speak is to pass a vector to someone else's autoencoder, hoping they can hallucinate

It seems like the software to viably transmit one person's brain state to the next would be far more complex than the brain itself.

# Neurofeedback


# Two-photon microscopy
Allows deeper images by capturing the fluorescence of two photons arriving at once. The captured light varies as a square of light intensity.

Because it is highly unlikely to get scattered light (at the particular measured wavelength) from elsewhere, your microscope can just capture **all** of the photons that come back (no imaging capacity needed). Therefore, we don't care if light gets scattered before arriving at the depth

Bandwidth
- 3 x 5 x 0.5 = 7.5 mm^2, 200 000 neurons at 200 ms - 1 million samples/second
  - for reference, there are 1 million RGCs


# Questions
- How do you connect chip to neuron?
- How does color get convolved?
- How many neurons for MRI, ultrasound resolution?
- What do we know about Zebrafish?
- Do we have anything better than Hebbian learning?
- What are the challenges for C. Elegans WBE?
