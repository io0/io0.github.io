There's a sense in which websites are just places. Like college, a cafe, or Singapore. Web users can teleport anywhere, so places on the web tend to be formed around their internal characteristics, like interests, hobbies, and problems.

People make places. Tumblr was filled with teenagers. Pinterest started off with middle-aged moms. The more middle-aged moms there were, the more middle-aged moms it attracted, and now it has 400 million people, most of which are middle-aged moms.

Places are bespoke. A cafe might have reading lamps, jazz music, green velvet chairs. Our psychological space is enormous, so the value of a place is how it constrains it. A place has rich affordances to get you to read, to linger.
