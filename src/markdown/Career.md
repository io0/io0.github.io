## Curiosities / what should I do with my career

Jeff Bezos made a thing that distributes goods really fast. He gives people goods and puts goods where they're desired.

Somewhere in my vision I want higher levels of mental life. The cavemen were biologically as capable of intelligence--in fact their brains were larger than ours. But our caveman Shakespeare could only grunt.

Beliefs have changed before. Once it was believed that only the rich could learn how to read, that the poor had literally inferior minds.

We still believe this. We still think there is no way _everyone_ could become as educated as we are,

My family tree becomes peasants just 2 generations back and then its peasants all the way down

Balance between intimacy and legibility [of Twitter, of social capital]

I want to know, but I dont want to know too much

Mercenaries

Taylor says I should fight for another startup for a while, but . It would be surprising if there exists a startup that matched your vision.

Artists create an articulation of the future

I want to start a hotel in SF
