<!-- Being a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script yet in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

I was a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script. Being in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

For a child without a single social script to learn the way of these Western worlds on their own, the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I was five and had yet to know a single social script; being required to learn a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity surreal.

the experience of living quickly became surreal
quite suddenly I got a stunning experience of humanity.

I changed schools once a year for six years. From China to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto, I followed along while my parents figured out Western society for themselves. I had yet to learn a single social script when I was forced to learn many at once; my experience of humanity became quite stunning.

Know when to laugh and when to stop; learn French â€” now learn English; learn what pizza is because everyone seems to know it and if you don't then you must be dumb or strange. My heart rate spiked, I girded my loins. I was always in anticipation of these tiny little witch trials.

Childhood created an immense inner life. One time in grade two we had to write short stories. There were twenty or so stories about a boy named Sam looking for his puppy. Mine, produced in monk-like handwriting, was about a bird named Springshine who flew around the world to change the seasons. 

I was fascinated by the color chartreuse. I hoarded bits and pieces of text about politics, old things, churches, dragons, the [Monkey King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King), the gold rush. I didn't know what they really were, but had a preverbal sense that these things were fantastic. 
<!-- Textures I could feel in my mind but could never find in others.  -->

I truly loved the textures I could feel in my mind but could never find in others. I wrote short stories in a single Word document that grew to 102k words by the time I was 12 years old. 

I discovered science a little less organically. A teacher in high school told me I was good, and 

my internal vocabulary consisted of elements of fantasy books.

I was not awkward . Interacting with people fell into a conscious part of the brain. Planning what to say next, watching rigidly for what to do.

Research had the qualia of being spawned at a random point on a game map. I was working with ideas like PEG-PLA and nano evaporation, cooking up nanoparticles with sonication arbitrary instantiation.

Raffi remarked that to do neurotech properly, you needed to know math, physics, neuroscience, and design.
