I was a five-year-old who hadn't learned a single social script. Being in a context that required a lot of them in a short amount of time made the experience of humanity somewhat surreal.

For a child without a single social script to learn the way of these Western worlds on their own, the experience of humanity becomes surreal.

I changed schools once a year for six years. From China to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto, I followed along while my parents figured out Western society for themselves. I had yet to learn a single social script when I was forced to learn many at once; the experience of humanity quickly became surreal.

I had to know when to laugh and when to stop; learn French â€” now learn English; learn what pizza is because everyone seems to know it and react to it, and if you don't then you must be dumb or strange. My heart rate spiked, I went on overdrive thinking about what to say. Childhood created an intense internal life. 


In grade two, the kids would write short stories. Curt, short sentences about a boy named Sam who walked to the store. Then, in monk-like handwriting, a story about a bird named Springshine with feathers that could revive the forest. 

I was fascinated by the color chartreuse.

I was not awkward . Interacting with people fell into a conscious part of the brain. Planning what to say next, watching rigidly for what to do.

Research had the qualia of being spawned at a random point on a game map. I was working with ideas like PEG-PLA and nano evaporation, cooking up nanoparticles with sonication arbitrary instantiation.
