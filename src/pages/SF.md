# Going to San Francisco!
## Why am I here?
#### Inspiration
Primarily to feel inspired. By specific ideas (what is everyone working on right now?) and by the values of the community, to regain the energy to work.

#### Friends
Meet people to make *friends* -- friends are very different from acquaintances. 
- How do you make friends? even if you know someone and are comfortable with them, it can take a long time to get to a point of intellectual honesty
- when I was recruiting for School 2.0, why were there so many people for which I was shy to send them a message? Is it that they and I were not as compatible, or that I have not gained the requisite openness?

#### Mentors
tbd

#### Projects
If its one month, we need to think about how we can work on projects (less time on each project for more exposure, or one or two longer projects?) 

##### my own ideas
- Invasive EMG as a new interface
  - You are capable of controlling single neurons in your brain
  - a tool for thought
  - neurofeedback seems very powerful and underexplored
  - can we learn something about augmentation (interplay of human and tech) that leads to novel research directions?
- Crypto
  - A social graph
  - A social verification graph
  - get married on the blockchain
- Mental teleportation
Visit my mind, but I dont have to be present for it to happen. Thumb through my books, my words, my visions.

#### Deliverables
1. NeuroTech FAQ
2. A BLOG. Signpost your existence.


What am I going to do tomorrow?


I feel like this stuff is too open-ended. Better to have a specific plan and modify it as I go. Maybe that concrete plan is meeting Max Hodak and reading a bunch of neurotech papers

Actually, if Neurotech is the goal then making that Neurotech FAQ is more important.
- Alexey Guzey spent a year reading and writing about life sciences before he landed on his New Science institute

**A big question I have is, is computational neuroscience a sham?** Some branches of science are fake, some are underexplored, it seems likely that an entire field can be memed into the wrong direction (e.g. Amyloid plagues)


TODO
1. Read a paper
2. email Max Hodak
3. DM Taylor and David
4. **about my current self** post
