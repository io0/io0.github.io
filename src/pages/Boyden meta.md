# Conversation with Ed Boyden

## Teaching people to do science

> You can teach problem-solving

Ed Boyden has taught for many years, only with this recent course he believes he's found a way to teach problem-solving. The students presented midterm projects recently and he felt **every project was worth pursuing.**

- The course teaches students to be skeptical in the right way
- There are exercises at the beginning
  - The students go and interview 6 people and relate what they learned
  - Teach them how to read papers (there's a way)
  - Emphasis on how to figure out the truth
- It takes prep time (4-6 sessions) to get people to think about the real problem versus "fake problems"
  - He asks them things like, "what is the problem?"
  - For example, what is a synapse? If you keep asking, you eventually get to a place where no one knows
- Know where knowledge ends and assumptions begin

## General heuristics for research

> There are only so many chemical and physical laws. 

When faced with a problem, Boyden's lab will start with a tiling tree. They're deliberate about scientific discovery: the tiling tree forces them to look at the space of _all_ possible solutions. 

For example, you could think of all the sources of energy (there are only a handful) — EM waves, ultrasound, mechanical — and divide your space, working your way to finer divisions until the leaf nodes are projects.

#### Fail constructively
Most things will fail. Especially in biomedicine, things are more likely to fail than not. Seek failures that tell you something about the underlying principles of a system.

There's usually a partial success in a failure. In our lab, the biggest failures have become our biggest successes.

- Write the outline of a paper before the experiment.
  - this forces you to think about the **analysis** and not just what you're measuring
- Make use of partial successes
  - if all the neurons survive but all the glia die, what can you say about your treatment?
    - what metabolic processes are unique to neurons?
- Seek general principles
  - Suppose your treatment fails in 8 ways in the hamster, while failing in the pig in 9 other ways. From this, you can't make general statements. If, however, the pig and hamster fail in the same ways, you can claim underlying principles
    - The results of individual experiments are not as important as the _comparison_ of what happens in each organism
  - Consider Alzheimer's research: people are using 3 different molecular models of Alzheimer's
    - you need to find effects in all 3 models to claim general principles
    - makes me want to do a company that runs human trials for Alzheimer's

- Boyden's lab tried all sorts of polymers for expansion microscopy that weren't working (literally hundreds of them). Someone suggested proteinases offhand, which wasn't taken seriously at the time <span class="annotation">Reference: [Expansion Microscopy: Protocols for Imaging Proteins and RNA in Cells and Tissues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6158110/) </span>
  - circled the problem back to physics/chemistry

#### Quantity over quality

Do a lot of experiments, some of which are quite dumb.

> Take a Fourier transform of an image of Alzheimers? Sounds stupid

- E.g. discovering periodic structure of amyloid

  - initially it was a scatter of dots, but we realized there was periodic structure


    - generated novel hypothesis on amyloid effect on excitability of neurons\* <span class="annotation">Reference: [Decrowding Proteins to Unmask Invisible Brain Nanostructures \| bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273540v1.full)</span>
      - decades of work has found amyloid plaques to be correlated with Alzheimer's, but if you remove the plaque, nothing happens

- "Off-by-1 inputs"

  - Let's say you do an experiment with dose 1, dose 10, dose 100 and they all fail

    - it may be that the dose is still approaching threshold, need to try dose 500
    - only understood if you measure the right things (e.g. RNAseq)

- Dependency graph
  - use it to sequence experiments, but be aware that your initial plan is usually scrapped

## Recruiting
You want people who will go wherever the science needs them to go. For example, if you have someone in physics and the project takes them into chemistry, they should be willing to learn chemistry.

One of our tricks is to take people in an intuitive science (biology, material science, chemistry) and put them in a different field. In contrast you have people in computer science and electrical engineering, which are more quantitative sciences.

When interviewing, we like to ask:
- What's the most creative thing that you've done?
- What is the fundamental definition of your problem? Can you go deeper?

Finally, always ask for reference letters. The only problematic relationship we had in the lab (over many years) could have been avoided if we had asked for a reference letter.
