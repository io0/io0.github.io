# School 2.0

Truchas, New Mexico
Middle of nowhere (2 hours to groceries)
26 people
2 months + quarantine
"strong community" - everyone's lives, up and down the Mazlow's hierarchy, was dictated by the community

Values

- kindness
- curiosity

Recruitment

- referral
- self-selected for adventurousness

# outcomes

- changing people's trajectories (4 people dropped out or took time off school, J+E founding companies)
- Jonathan "I didn't know you could be this curious"
- people making great friends and almost everyone continuing to live with each other in smaller group homes after s2
- I find the idea of role models to be really powerful

# learnings

- huge amount of buy-in
- dominated your social life, 100% of people for 20% of the year vs 20% of people for 100% of the year
