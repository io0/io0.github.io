> This changed my life

> around half the people here are working or recently worked in startups they cofounded so i’m learning way more about startup culture than i ever wanted to though it is interesting.
>
>  it’s definitely the first time in a while, since winter sparc at the very least, where i’ve consistently felt like the least competent person in the room (minimum room size 5 people) which, honestly, is a great thing to feel again after 9 months
>
> in a lot of ways it feels like i’m getting most of the things i wanted to experience in college but couldn’t find at mit. like, i finally get a blank slate because nobody knows much about my background, i’m finally in a place where close to 100% of the conversations i have are interesting, i finally feel obligated to be the best version of me all the time, and it’s actually ridiculous how much more clearly i can think now

There was no way to know beforehand if people would like each other. We ran a couple virtual socials, which were fun but weren't influential in decisions either way. I held my breath leading up to School 2.0, worried that people wouldn't like each other. Only after a week or two, seeing everyone gathered in Geffen's bedroom for late night snacks, did I feel release.

Learning happens in an environment rich in surprise. The people were new, and so was everything else about Truchas. We were surrounded by rich affordances: trails, rivers, horses you could feed whenever you wanted to. On the first night half the house went out to stare at the stars.

Rich affordances, 
Stargazing

- over half of the people knew only one or two others coming in
- Snowball fight
What is curiosity?
- We asked people to teach us something during the call
- 

The biggest surprise was that it happened, it worked. No one had reasons to be in New Mexico, everyone came for each other, for people they knew would also be coming for other people. Unincorporated town of 
Rich textures: Golden wood with stained glass lamps. 
Always someone up around the clock. 
- Amanda used the words "intentionality", Noah used the word "earnest"
- screenshot of the learning experiment topics
- Tiago said that we got the order wrong: focus on community first, then the learning will happen afterwards
    - Jason Yu had originally posed the question of "how do you reconcile learning with power?"
    - e.g. a teacher in a classroom has power over the students
- Failure modes
    - oversocialization
        - I sat out on a lot of dinners
        - there was ALWAYS something going on
    - did not seem compatible with "execution mode"
        - people with jobs seemed to do fine / get work done, but my sense is that the particularly self-driven types of work suffered

What does it mean to learn/explore?

# School 2.0

School 2.0 was a learning experiment in Truchas, New Mexico.

Middle of nowhere (2 hours to groceries)
26 people
2 months + quarantine
"strong community" - everyone's lives, up and down the Mazlow's hierarchy, was dictated by the community

Values

- kindness
- curiosity

Recruitment

- referral
- self-selected for adventurousness

# outcomes

- changing people's trajectories (4 people dropped out or took time off school, J+E founding companies)
- Jonathan "I didn't know you could be this curious"
- people making great friends and almost everyone continuing to live with each other in smaller group homes after s2
- I find the idea of role models to be really powerful

# learnings

- huge amount of buy-in
- dominated your social life, 100% of people for 20% of the year vs 20% of people for 100% of the year

> “it’s fundamentally dehumanizing to be surrounded by people and then never interact and engage with them.”

- upstairs vs downstairs
    - library upstairs, rooms downstairs
    - people upstairs collaborated more
- who would be friends with who game
- structured vs unstructured activities: even though most of your friends might have come through unstructured activities, there are so many more sources of unstructured than structured activities, that per activity, structured activities still seem more effective
- encouraging people to start their own initiatives -- the best initiatives were started by people in the house (Amanda and Ethan's thanksgiving notes, Tiago's Missing Pieces)
- walking culture
- relationship building accelerates greatly when people realized school 2.0 was coming to an end
- school 2.0 as a city: what do people tell you to be?
