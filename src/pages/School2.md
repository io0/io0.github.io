# School 2.0: The story of what happened.

> In a lot of ways it feels like I’m getting most of the things I wanted to experience in college but couldn’t find at MIT. Like, I finally get a blank slate because nobody knows much about my background, I’m finally in a place where close to 100% of the conversations I have are interesting, I finally feel obligated to be the best version of me all the time, and it’s actually ridiculous how much more clearly i can think now

School 2.0 was an experiment in learning in Truchas, New Mexico. It started out of existential need: everything was shut down in October 2020 and no one was thinking about the disaster in young people's mental lives. It was a space for people to learn and be together, and it grew into an expression of what education could look like.

We found a farmhouse in a remote village. There were 26 of us in all, average age 22 years old (min 18, max 29). We found people through word of mouth and referral, posting to communities like Interact, Pioneer, Neo, and Hack Lodge. Our [webpage](https://school2point0.com/) was designed for people who love projects.

We ran a minimalist selection process: a form and a 15-minute chat. We asked one question: what are you curious about? We looked for people who could teach us things.

#### Friendships
<!-- There was no way to know beforehand if people would like each other. We ran a couple virtual socials, which were fun but weren't influential in decisions either way.  -->
I was worried sick in the days leading up to School 2.0. What if people didn't like each other? We were convincing everyone to come to something we ourselves didn't know. Most people came in blind or with only one other person they knew from before.

In the second week, there was a moment when everyone gathered in Geffen's bedroom for late night snacks, and I feel a sense of release. This was going to work.

Almost everyone continued to live with each other in smaller group homes after School 2.0. Vincent went to Alaska with Dmitri, who ended up being the person with whom he "spent the most time with this year". On two separate occasions I lived with friends and their families, in Boston and Ecuador.

#### Shared experiences
- cooking - 5 hour experience
- eating
- hiking
- walks (were the only 1:1 activity)
- cleaning

#### Structured stuff
- learning experiment
- paper experiment
- Missing Piece
- big questions club

Things that weren't there
- status
- social media
felt consistently good

#### Venue is way more important than we thought
- sunniness
- library
- upstairs vs downstairs
    - library upstairs, rooms downstairs
    - people upstairs collaborated more

#### Could I live in this state?
- no
- I want to return to this at some frequency
- did not seem compatible with "execution mode"
    - people with jobs seemed to do fine / get work done, but my sense is that the particularly self-driven types of work suffered

Learning happens in an environment rich in surprise. The people were new, and so was everything else about Truchas. We were surrounded by rich affordances: trails, rivers, horses you could feed whenever you wanted to. On the first night half the house went out to stare at the stars.

- hacks
    - weekend
    - build culture
- over half of the people knew only one or two others coming in
- Snowball fight
What is curiosity?
- We asked people to teach us something during the call
- 
Rich textures: Golden wood with stained glass lamps. 
Always someone up around the clock. 
- Amanda used the words "intentionality", Noah used the word "earnest"
- screenshot of the learning experiment topics
- Tiago said that we got the order wrong: focus on community first, then the learning will happen afterwards
    - Jason Yu had originally posed the question of "how do you reconcile learning with power?"
    - e.g. a teacher in a classroom has power over the students
- Failure modes
    - oversocialization
        - I sat out on a lot of dinners
        - there was ALWAYS something going on
    - did not seem compatible with "execution mode"
        - people with jobs seemed to do fine / get work done, but my sense is that the particularly self-driven types of work suffered

What does it mean to learn/explore?


Middle of nowhere (2 hours to groceries)
26 people
2 months + quarantine
"strong community" - everyone's lives, up and down the Mazlow's hierarchy, was dictated by the community

Values

- kindness
- curiosity

Recruitment

- referral
- self-selected for adventurousness

# outcomes

- changing people's trajectories (4 people dropped out or took time off school, J+E founding companies)
- Jonathan "I didn't know you could be this curious"
- I find the idea of role models to be really powerful

# learnings

- huge amount of buy-in
- dominated your social life, 100% of people for 20% of the year vs 20% of people for 100% of the year

> “it’s fundamentally dehumanizing to be surrounded by people and then never interact and engage with them.”


---
- upstairs vs downstairs
    - library upstairs, rooms downstairs
    - people upstairs collaborated more
- who would be friends with who game
- structured vs unstructured activities: even though most of your friends might have come through unstructured activities, there are so many more sources of unstructured than structured activities, that per activity, structured activities still seem more effective
- encouraging people to start their own initiatives -- the best initiatives were started by people in the house (Amanda and Ethan's thanksgiving notes, Tiago's Missing Pieces)
- walking culture
- relationship building accelerates greatly when people realized school 2.0 was coming to an end
- school 2.0 as a city: what do people tell you to be?
