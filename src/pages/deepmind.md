## The story of how Demis got his first investment in DeepMind
Context:
- This was around 2010, no one was investing in AI
- There was no clear product and the vision sounded like blue sky research
- Most investors would see it as something you did in academia for ten years. Demis needed it to be done faster

##### Transcript

> We spent a year preparing for this meeting.

It was an important meeting because we knew that not very many people would get what we were doing, and this was one of the people that we felt who would.

We couldn't get meetings because we had no contacts in Silicon Valley.

We finally managed to get asked to a conference where this billionaire was sponsoring. We knew we would meet him at some sort of after-party.
The problem is that there are hundreds of people all trying to pitch him their ideas, and you're just another one pitching another crazy idea.

Instead of that, I thought I would take a calculated risk and talk to him about chess instead. But then you'd have to have something interesting about chess that maybe you hadn't thought of.

So I used my number one fact on chess that even surprises grandmasters, which is that thinking about it from a game designer point of view, why is chess such a great game? What is it that makes it so great?

My belief is that it's actually because of the creative tension between the bishop and knight. They're worth the same (3 points each) but they have completely different powers. That asymmetry that happens with the bishop and knights being swapped into various positions I think is what makes chess such a fascinating game

So I basically led out with that line — I don't know how I managed to crow bar that into a drinks party — but I did, and it made him sort of stop and think, which is exactly what I was hoping. And then he invited us back the next day to do a proper pitch of our business idea. So we got half an hour instead of a minute over drinks.

Chess worked on two levels there: the meta level of planning things out, and also actually chess is an intriguing subject itself.
